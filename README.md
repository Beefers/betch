# betch

A fetch script written in batch. Fair warning, this is horrible.

# How to use

`git clone https://kreatea.space/beef/betch.git && cd betch`

If on Windows, simply run it as usual, i.e. `betch` or `betch.cmd`.
If on Linux, install Wine and run it using `wine cmd /c betch.cmd`
(Linux compatibility is not guaranteed and never will be)
